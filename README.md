### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as Lab Technican at Experis while being outsourced to <b>Intel</b>.
In my spare time, I am doing courses related to application testing in order to be able to steer towards QA / Tester in the future.
I also have knowledge in programming in languages such as C, C++, JAVA, Python, and I'm no stranger to web stack. All this I had in technical school, and now I am extending it with the knowledge I gain during my studies at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

My current job is repairing, setting up and configuring setups for Audio tests. In my free time, I look for ways to systematise my work and create apps, like [RaritanKiller](https://github.com/Kosiem/RaritanKiller) or [J-SSH](https://github.com/Kosiem/J-SSH-app).

Courses which i have ended or i am still working at:<br>
[Practical Software Testing](https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-cucumber-integration/)

My projects related to it: <br>
[Postman API testing](https://github.com/Kosiem/API-Testing-JSONPlaceholder/tree/main)
[Practicing Automation with Selenium](https://github.com/Kosiem/Social-Media-Logger)
